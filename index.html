            <p>Hi! I'm Isaac, a student at BYU Idaho from Chile, studying Web and Computer Programming. I love learning new things and enjoy making new friends along the way! I‚Äôve been passionate about programming since I was 13, when I participated in a competitive programming workshop for young students at the Universidad Cat√≥lica de Concepci√≥n. That‚Äôs where my interest in software development really took off.

                At 18, I had the opportunity to assist my uncle, a programmer and university professor, with some web projects, which deepened my curiosity and knowledge in the field. Now, I work as a junior front-end web developer at BilbaoLabs, a company focused on software and web development for various businesses. Alongside this, I take on personal web projects, ranging from simple websites for individuals to local stores in my area.
                
                While working, I‚Äôm also studying Software Development at Brigham Young University Idaho, applying everything I learn to my current projects and growing both personally and professionally.
